## Data Description \ WeatherPy
Retrieves weather data for a list of randomly selected cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
The dataset includes weather information for randomly chosen cities. It contains details
like latitude, longitude, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, country, and date.
The data covers various geographic areas and periods of time.

## Data Description \ VacationPy
This data analysis provides travel recommendations based on user preferences and real-time weather data.
By analyzing weather conditions and geographical features, VacationPy can assist users in identifying optimal vacation destinations.

## Files Included
VacationPy.ipynb
WeatherPy.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data retrieval, analysis, and visualization.
api_keys.py - Python script containing your API key for the OpenWeatherMap API (not included in the repository for security reasons).

## Key Metrics / WeatherPy

Temperature based on (F) vs. Latitude
Humidity based on (%) vs. Latitude
Cloudiness based on (%) vs. Latitude
Wind Speed based on (mph) vs. Latitude

## Results / WeatherPy
- Latitude Vs. Temperature: After obtaining the results graphically, a clear trend emerges: places closer to the equator are typically warmer 
than those farther away. Latitude significantly influences temperature patterns.

- Latitude Vs. Humidity:Upon analyzing the graphed results, there is no discernible correlation between Latitude and Humidity. It is evident
  that Humidity levels exhibit significant variation across different locations, a variability attributed to the influence of local weather
  conditions and geographic factors.

- Latitude vs. Cloudiness: Cloud cover varies from one location to another and is influenced by local weather patterns and atmospheric conditions.
  The graph does not show any correlation.

- Latitude vs. Wind Speed Plot:The scatter plot indicates that there is no notable correlation between latitude and wind speed.
  Wind patterns show significant diversity across different latitudes, influenced by a combination of local weather systems and geographic features.

## Results / VacationPy

Through the integration of Jupyter notebooks, the GeoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API, VacationPy offers a comprehensive solution for vacation planning. 
It enhances the user experience by providing relevant information directly on the map, streamlining the travel planning process and ensuring convenience for the users.
